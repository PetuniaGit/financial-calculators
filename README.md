One piece of code I find interesting is `double presentvalue= monthlypayout*(1-Math.pow(1+ monthlyinterestrate,-totalmonth))/monthlyinterestrate;`
It is interesting because it combines math and coding logic. Being able to use math functions available in Java makes it user-friendly and solves problems efficiently.
